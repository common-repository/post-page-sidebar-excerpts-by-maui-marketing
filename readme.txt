1. Activate the Post & Page Sidebar Excerpts by Maui Marketing plugin.
2. In each post and page there will be additional sections where you can add excerpts. You can add a title and excerpt as we suggest but it is flexible.
3. In choosing to display the excerpts you first choose a title of the page you want to select an excerpt from.  Then you can choose to load one of the excerpts you have added.  If there is none, the dropdown will show none.
4. This shows two excerpts added but you can add as many as you want, and with as many combinations too, reducing duplicate content issues.
